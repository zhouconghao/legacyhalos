Stellar Mass Content of Dark Matter Halos in Legacy Surveys Imaging
===================================================================

The `DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys`_ have delivered deep *grz* optical imaging and
unWISE *W1* and *W2* mid-infrared imaging of over 20,000 sq. deg of the
extragalactic sky.

This repository contains code and papers for a multi-pronged analysis of the
group- and cluster-scale dark matter halos identified in Legacy Survey imaging,
particularly the stellar mass content of the central galaxies.  

The key science goals are to:

1. Obtain an accurate census of the integrated stellar masses of massive central
   galaxies---which dominate the massive end of the galaxy stellar mass
   function---as a function of halo mass and redshift.

2. Measure the stellar mass density profiles and structural properties (e.g.,
   half-mass radius, concentration), and their correlation with dark matter halo
   assembly histories.  

3. Measure the stellar mass-halo mass relation and the scatter in the stellar
   masses of central galaxies, as a probe of star formation efficiency and
   feedback in massive systems.

4. Measure the fraction of stars formed *in situ* versus *ex situ* in massive
   spheroidal galaxies.

5. And much more...!
